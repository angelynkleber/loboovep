                            <p>I saw the church on the grey horizon miles before I felt compelled to drive up to it. It was rickety looking, even from a ways away, like something out of Scary Stories To Tell In the Dark. The splintered, weathered boards holding it together were a faded beige, singed with black bits and chipped (white?) paint from decades before. I absently drove in its direction. Mesmerized, robotic actions guided me up the winding hill it sat atop. There were no other cars here. It looked long abando. A Seaside British Pub (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/45bwzq/there_are_few_things_as_depressing_and_shitty_as/) Ships aren’t exactly a rare sight in the bay. Inbound vessels chug through the foam-scudded surf into the harbour, keen to return to land after a sojourn at sea. But when winter reaches its freezing zenith, bringing storms full of ice and thirty metre swells, most of the ships huddle against the piers. Very few of them are large enough or foolish enough to brave the solsti. (Read the previous part here (/r/DestinyJournals/comments/98fys4/on_the_front_release/)) I fuzzed into existence on a wide golden causeway, tall white columns with lit braziers running it’s full length. The Leviathan grew up like a mountain before me. Layers of interlinking pathways and tiers ascended hundreds of feet into the air. And at the peak of this hulking facade, a Cabal’s Head looming over it all. Marking an entryway? And every inch of it was painted gold. Ahead of me, several. Jacob’s eyes slowly cracked open as a sound resounded through the room. The silence that followed and the soft sound of April’s breaths lulled him back into slumber, until he heard it again. A loud, wet slap, followed by a dragging noise. Jacob shot up, and April groaned at her awakening. “What’s up?” April croaked sleepily, her arms twisting above her head as she tried to orient herself in the waking world. “I heard something,” Jacob placed a hand on April’s forearm. “You stay here. I’ll.

The cold air slapped him in the face and the smell of snow and blood triggered an adrenaline rush. This post is the second in a series of four posts on representing “primitive” cultures in DnD - how to do so with greater historical accuracy, and in a way which leads to more interesting and meaningful encounters for your players. Part one covered barbarians, and a brief discussion of the idea that “primitive” societies are not ‘behind’ or ‘less developed’ than other societies; they have just developed differently in a way that is appropriate for their geography, people and culture. Part three. 
Celebrian stood before the goblin king, head bowed. Her long silver locks hid her face. Silent tears streamed down dirty checks. The orcs had not mistreated her—woe to any orc who spoiled the king’s pleasure-toy. But the hem of her traveling dress was wet and muddied by the long walk through water logged tunnels. Her hair was matted and her arms were muddied, bruised and cut from many a tumble in the dark. None of that mattered compared to the fate that awaited her at the hands of this so-calle. This is Part 2 of Chapter 18: Flight. Part 1 can be found here (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3oia4n/oc_corridors_chapter_18_flight_part_1/) --- Ambassador Evans strode through the glass panel doors as they swished open, and took a moment just past their threshold to drink in the scene before him. He breathed in deeply, and managed to suppress a sneeze as it tried to force itself upon him. Multicoloured Onathins strolled up and down the joyfully lit main concourse of Sechalla Station. Just like with the release of 'The Marshall Mathers LP2', we created this Megathread along with the discussion threads to prevent the frontpage of this subreddit from flooding. And remember, just like every SotW post or previous Megathreads, we want this to be an open thread, so feel free to discuss everything SHADYXX!

As we last left off, our raiding party was just blasted by a colorless goo covered dragon-headed koi fish. We quickly reorganized and began moving towards the beast. Within moments, we had all of our primary DPS projected at the creature, with both of our tanks trading off right before his attack so he couldn't land a blow. In the next moment, I directed the AoE to all be sent out in front of the chunks of the walls that had slid open. Out of these openings, what can only be described. 
In the dark of the winters his belief in everything began to fade. White clouds and blue skies and sun beams all around brought happiness and contentedness, and so long as the spring buds brought forth sweetness in the fall people would still come, and swap various things and dance in time to the gentle wind that blew in from the rolling hills that did rustle and gently jostle the chimes above the hearth. And as a chill grew in the air people would come to huddle in the warmth of the Junnypede. I would love some honest feedback - cheers ------------------------------- In the dark of the winters his belief in everything began to fade.
